## Summary ##

First of Type (FoT) is an iterative cycle that facilitates the development, self-assessment, assurance and live deployment of supplier systems consuming the GP Connect API. The scope of FoT is to test processes in line with the GP Connect Developer ecosystem, which has been created to assist commissioning organisations and consuming suppliers on their journey to deploying a live service. 

First of Type is limited to a select group of sites and suppliers that have demonstrated the broadest range of usage. This will provide the widest information and lessons to incorporate into general release.

Suppliers representing all application types (such as electronic patient records (EPR), middleware, and regional care record portals) are ideal, as we'd like to understand how third-party accreditation and assurance processes works across all supported system types.

Participating suppliers and sites will need to agree to a delivery roadmap and to some lightweight reporting and communication obligations.

## FoT timelines ##

**HTML Access Record**

FoT began in November 2016 when principal system suppliers started assurance of their HTML record access provider capability. FoT ends following successful completion of all activities needed to allow business as usual (BAU) implementation. Regular progress updates will be provided via the GitHub site when key milestones are achieved.


**Appointments**

FoT implementations of appointment capabilities are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2018.

## FoT approach ##

Those agreed as FoT candidates will be allocated into a tranche. Each tranche will receive reducing levels of support from the GP Connect project team with those in the final tranche receiving support replicating the level of resource available when the service enters BAU.

## FoT candidate selection ##

There's a large amount of interest in taking part in the early stages of GP Connect and this interest will far outstrip the number of places available. The number of places available will also depend on how smoothly the FoT process goes once started.

To be considered as part of the FoT, NHS organisations that want to commission systems to consume the APIs should complete the FoT candidate questionnaire. Questionnaire responses will firstly be validated to ensure the application is suitable. Validation will ensure:

-	commissioning bodies understand that taking part in the FoT means that certain processes and activities may not be streamlined and that extra work is needed from organisations (and suppliers) to help create a scalable process
-	commissioning bodies are actively engaged with developers of the consuming product and have funding available to cover any development costs if required
-	candidates are drawing upon a provider API and an API capability that is under development, and the delivery aligns with the estimated tranche start date
-	a commissioning body has existing data sharing agreements in place and understands that these may need uplifting depending on local circumstances
-	that all local work for implementing the capabilities is the responsibility of the local organisations and that no extra funding to support this is available from NHS Digital

Following initial validation, candidates will be reviewed by both NHS Digital and NHS England to determine which of them will be provisionally allocated into a tranche. It is anticipated 2 to 4 commissioning organisations will be selected per tranche. Any selections made by the selection group will be validated by the GP Connect project board. Unsuccessful applicants will be contacted as soon as possible after any decisions have been made.

## HTML Access Record FoT tranche 1 candidates ##

The following candidates have been selected for tranche 1:

|Commissioning authority|Care setting|Geographical location|
|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|
|NHS Kernow CCG| General practice - federated working| North and South Kerrier|
|Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust| Cross care setting shared record (Leeds Care Record)|Leeds|

## HTML Access Record FoT tranche 2 and 3 selection ##

We are currently accepting applications for future tranches. 

## How to be involved ##

Commissioning bodies looking to engage in FoT activities should ensure that they fully understand the capabilities being created, have sound use cases to maximise benefits arising from them and understand that taking part in the process will need active organisational involvement.  Following this, please email the GP Connect team at <gpconnect@nhs.net> to express an interest and request the latest version of the FoT candidate questionnaire.

Suppliers who would like to be considered must enter the process with a commissioning NHS organisation.
