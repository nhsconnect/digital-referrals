Note that not all activities are illustrated. For instance Target Operating Model, Clinical Safety assessment and Information Governance (IG) assurance.

As shown in the figure above, a typical scenario involves the following steps:

* a **Business Partner** has an innovative idea related to the e-Referral Service
* the Partner visits the NHS e-RS API Web Portal and navigates to the **Get Started** section
after reading the provided development information (which additionally covers other technical and non-technical documentation), they decide to gain hands-on experience of the API and register their interest
* they get in touch with the Integration Team and arrange to fill in a **Target Operating Model (TOM)**, a light-weight framework used to self-assure the Partner's system confirming it meets the requirements and passes compliance
<!-- * still on the Web Portal, they navigate to the API Console that allows them to Explore individual API operations (Subject to access provision) -->
* after completing the TOM, they proceed to acquire a reasonable grasp of the API framework and begin the development lifecycle (**Design**, **Implement** and **System Test**) of the new software product
<!-- * during this process, the Web Portal provides all the necessary Support including code samples, forums, and bug tracking features -->
<!-- * the Ecosystem will provide test environments for both **System Tests** as well as **Integration Tests** -->
* when the new software has been successfully integrated with an existing clinical system, subject to satisfying the relevant assurance process it will be certified as an NHS e-RS API **Certified Product**, after which it can be deployed in a live setting
