The NHS e-Referral Service works hand in hand with the NHS Digital Business Partners team. As the NHS has evolved, the range of NHS providers from the independent and third sectors offering NHS-commissioned services and requiring information management and technology (IM&T) integration has increased significantly.

Recognising the growing importance of these sectors to the NHS and the need for effective integration with national systems and applications, NHS Digital introduced this new programme team (previously known as the Independent Sector Healthcare programme).

The team provides a dedicated contact point for both NHS commissioners and, where appropriate, their contracted healthcare providers and their system suppliers. They can:

* Provide advice and guidance on integrating with NHS systems and applications, tailored to the needs of commissioners and healthcare providers.
* Support providers and their system suppliers with achieving system compliance with NHS systems and services.

For external third party suppliers, who may not have a existing relationship with the NHS e-RS nor connectivity to existing core NHS solutions such as Spine, the team can act as a useful first port of call. Please view the following [link](https://digital.nhs.uk/NHS-Business-Partners).
