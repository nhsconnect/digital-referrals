Once your product has proceeded through the assurance and compliance process, your First-of-Type (FoT) user will gain a live solution accreditation and access. This will then progress to the NHS Digital Service Management team to confirm the release and transfer into business as usual status. Service Management manages and protects live service for all of our major IT systems and provide live service service statistics, deployment issues and incident responses.
