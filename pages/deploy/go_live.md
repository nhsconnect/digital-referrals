### Going live
Once all the steps laid out in the [compliance approach](assure_compliance_approach.html) have been completed a set of live endpoint credentials will be issued.  

For enquiries relating to this process please contact the Interoperability Management Team by email at [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net)  

Once the live service API endpoints are issued a go-live process can be planned between the supplier and end-user organisation, without further requirement for approval from NHS Digital.

### Support during Go-live
During the process of going live you can contact [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net) for support relating to the issue of live credentials and endpoint setup.

### Support after Go-live
After go-live all support issues must be reported to the [NHS National Service Desk](mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net) who will log the details and either resolve the incident or ensure it is passed on to the appropriate NHS Digital team or other resource for resolution. You can also call the NHS National Service Desk on 0300 303 5035.
