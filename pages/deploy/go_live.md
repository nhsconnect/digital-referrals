## Going live
Once all the steps laid out in the [compliance approach](assure_compliance_approach.html) have been completed a set of live endpoint credentials will be issued.  

For enquiries relating to this process please contact the Interoperability Management Team by email at [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net)  

Once the live service API endpoints are issued the go-live can be planned by the supplier and end-user organisation, without further requirement for approval from NHS Digital.
