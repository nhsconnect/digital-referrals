Once all the steps laid out in the [compliance approach](assure_compliance_approach.html) have been completed a set of live endpoint credentials will be issued.  

For enquiries relating to this process please contact the Interoperability Management Team by email at [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net)  

_**Note:** Once the live service API endpoints are issued the go-live process can be managed between the supplier and end-user organisation, without further requirement for approval from NHS Digital._

### Support during Go-live
During the process of going live you can contact [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net) for support relating to the issue of live credentials and endpoint setup.

You can also call the NHS National Service Desk on 0300 303 5035.
