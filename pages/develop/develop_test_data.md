The Path-To-Live (PTL) environments, such as e-RS/DEV1 are populated with non-live data known as “Synthetic Test Data”. Test Data, such as Patient Demographic Data, Summary Care Records, Electronic Prescriptions and Organisational Data (including users and positions), can be requested from the Test Data Team.

A guide to the services that can be requested from the Test Data Team is available in the Test Data Catalogue.

All requests sent to the Test Data Team must be accompanied by a completed Test Data Request Form. Depending on what is being requested a relevant completed Test Data Template may also be required. Examples of the most commonly used standard packs along with descriptions on how to achieve the most common scenarios is available below the relevant template type.

If you require PDS data to be loaded into the Spine, then the PDS Requirements Template should be completed. Please contact the Test Data Team on 0113 397 3100 if you require assistance in completing this form.

If you require users to be loaded into the Spine, then the SDS User Requirements Template should be completed.

Test Data have a standard pack available for NHS e-RS API testing. These can be requested by registering with the Solutions Assurance (SA) Service Desk or simply completing the Test Data Request Form.

Completed forms should be sent to the Test Data Team.
