summary: "Example demonstrator applications for third partner solution providers"
---

The NHS e-Referral Service has worked to provide two example demonstrator applications for third partner solution providers to review, as a potential aid to product elaboration and conceptual design. These comprise a N3-based (non-smartcard) Consumer Example and an N3/smartcard based API Demonstrator.

## Consumer Example ##

The Consumer Example is a constituent element of the API Sandpit (Google Chrome browser only) and seeks to exemplify the authentication, reference and Clinical Referral Information (CRI) API Endpoints.

## API Demonstrator ##

The API Demonstrator, represents an individual packaged application, which has been designed to allow external business partners quicker Path-To-Live (PTL) environment configuration and setup. It requires a suitable Spine certificate-based endpoint, an appropriate copy of the NHS Digital Identity Agent client software and an appropriate smartcard and testdata. A copy of this demonstrator will be provided on request with PTL access co-ordinated through the Solutions Assurance Service Desk or N3-based Assurance Portal.
