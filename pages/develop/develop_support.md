The role of NHS e-Referral Service Integration Portfolio is to ensure that integration solutions designed, developed and delivered by NHS Digital and wider healthcare organisations are secure, work as they are expected to, and are clinically safe for patients.  

To support this the Integration Portfolio delivers application, compliance and infrastructure implementation through different methodologies, whether this is general advice and guidance, general interoperability questions or test environment support. Our specialist team members provide and co-ordinate:

-	Agile product delivery and implementation of NHS Digital commissioned IT solutions  
(By solution we mean the overall end-product or service, which can involve looking at software, hardware or a number of additional factors including how humans interact with the solutions.)
-	Delivery of technical and support services, including tooling, environments, test data and monitoring.
-	Compliance project support to health and social care customers outside of NHS Digital who are wanting to connect to NHS national services.
-	These systems are vital for all areas of health and social care. They are critical for health treatment. We make sure that they are available when clinicians, patients and social care users need them.
