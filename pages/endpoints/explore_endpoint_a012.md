##### Status: ![Beta](images/icons/api_beta.png)

### API URL

Base URL (Dev3): https://api.dev3.ers.ncrs.nhs.uk/ers-api/

| Method | URL | Authentication |
| -------------| --- | ---------------- |
| POST | STU3/v1/ReferralRequest/{UBRN}/$ers.maintainReferralLetter | Session Token [(Details)](develop_business_flow_bf001.html) |

### Description
As a Referring Clinician (/Administrator)  
I want to associate files I have uploaded to a referral  
So that I can create the referral letter  

### Prerequisite Operations
Each file to be attached to a referral needs to have been individually uploaded first by calling [A020: Upload file to document store](explore_endpoint_a020.html). A020 will have returned the e-RS file location of each uploaded file; these are the URLs that need to be passed to the Maintain Referral Letter API so that they can be associated to the referral and thus form the referral letter (which is to be considered as a "collection of files")

### Request Operation

#### Request Header

| Field Name | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| XAPI_ASID | The "Accredited System ID" issued to the third party |
| HTTP_X_SESSION_KEY | The session key generated by the Create Session endpoint (A001)  |
| Accept | `application/fhir+json` |
| Content-Type |	`application/fhir+json` |

#### Request Body
The Operation Definition for this endpoint is available on the FHIR server: [eRS-maintainReferralLetter-Operation-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/OperationDefinition/eRS-maintainReferralLetter-Operation-1/_history/1.0)

### Response

#### Success
HTTP Status code `200 (OK)` is returned. The response body contains the just updated [eRS-ReferralRequest-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/eRS-ReferralRequest-1)

#### Failure
