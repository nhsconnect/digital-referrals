| Method | URL | Authentication |
| -------------| --- | ---------------- |
| POST | STU3/v1/ReferralRequest/$ers.createReferralAndSendForTriage | Session Token [(Details)](develop_business_flow_bf001.html) |

### Description
As a Referring Clinician (/Administrator)  
I want to create a Referral in e-RS to a RAS Service and initiate the Triage process
So that I can progress my patients' care without logging into multiple applications

### Prerequisite Operations
The shortlisted services must be the result of a previously run [Patient Specific Service Search (A010)](explore_endpoint_a010.html) endpoint.
Some of the parameters provided in input to the Create Referral endpoint are dependent on the services selected:
- If any of the shortlisted services have the _referral letter required_ flag set to true then, when calling the Create Referral endpoint, the _intention to add a referral letter_ must be set to _NEED_TO_ADD_LATER_ (and the referrer will later need to attach some files with a separate call to the  [Maintain Referral Letter (A012)](explore_endpoint_a012.html))
- If any of the shortlisted services are marked as 'unaccredited' for the referrer (and only in this case) then, when calling the Create Referral endpoint, the referrer will need to provide a meaningful comment as to why they decided to override the accreditation
- When using the Triage Request flow (also known as a “RAS service”), this must be the only shortlisted service.

The service attributes are available from the [Patient Specific Service Search (A010)](explore_endpoint_a010.html) endpoint.

### Request Operation

#### Request Header

| Field Name | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| XAPI_ASID | The "Accredited System ID" issued to the third party |
| HTTP_X_SESSION_KEY | The session key generated by the Create Session endpoint (A001)  |
| Accept | `*/*`, `application/fhir+json` |

#### Request Body
The Operation Definition for this endpoint is available on the FHIR server:  [eRS-CreateReferralAndSendForTriage-Operation-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/OperationDefinition/eRS-CreateReferralAndSendForTriage-Operation-1)

| Parameter Name             | Cardinality | Type            | Notes |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----- |
| patient                    | 1..1        | Identifier      | The NHS Number of the patient who the referral being created is for. Format: ^[0-9]{10}$  |
| referringClinician         | 0..1        | Identifier      | Required if and only if the logged in user has a role of Referring Clinician Admin. Format: ^[0-9]{12}$    |
| contentSensitive           | 1..1        | Boolean         | An indication of whether the referral is to be marked as 'Sensitive'. If True, then users with non-clinical roles (e.g. Referring Admins and Service Provider Admin) will not be able to view the referral details.    |
| shortlist                  | 1..1        | Resource        | When sending for triage, the shortlist must contain exactly one service, and this must support the ‘triage request flow’. <br>Profile: [https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/eRS-Shortlist-List-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/eRS-Shortlist-List-1)  |
| unaccreditedComment | 0..1| String | An explanation of the reason why the user decided to shortlist an 'unaccredited' service, thus overriding the referrer rights rules that had been set for that service. Required if and only if the shortlist contains one or more 'unaccredited' services. |
| firstReminderLetterFollowUpDays | 1..1 | UnsignedInt | This parameter triggers a reminder letter to the patient to prompt them to book an appointment if they haven’t done so after x days. When sending for triage, the only acceptable value is 0, which means no follow up letter will be sent, as the patient does not need to book an appointment. |
| intentionToAddReferralLetter | 1..1| Coding | When sending for triage, a referral letter is always required; therefore the only acceptable value is NEED_TO_ADD_LATER. <br>Binding (required): [https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/ValueSet/eRS-ReferralLetterIntention-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/ValueSet/eRS-ReferralLetterIntention-1)|
