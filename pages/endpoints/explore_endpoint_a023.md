## Description
This API aims to make available e-RS functionality which will allow the retrieval of the “Advice and Guidance Requests” worklist by a Service Provider.
The behaviour for this retrieval is very similar to retrieval of worklists for Appointment Requests (e.g. the “Referrals for Review” worklist) but references FHIR ‘CommunicationRequest’ resources which are used to model e-RS Advice and Guidance Requests.

# OUTPUT
## Response: Success
If successful, all entries from the ‘Advice and Guidance Requests’ worklist matching the input criteria are returned and the response code 200 (OK) is returned.  

The Response Body is in the structure of a [eRS-FetchWorklist-List-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/eRS-FetchWorklist-List-1) and each entry within the List includes [Extension-eRS-AdviceAndGuidanceRequests-WorkListItem-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Extension-eRS-AdviceAndGuidanceRequests-WorkListItem-1).  

The fields within this extension are specific to the Advice and Guidance Requests worklist as follows:  

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| priority | Priority of the Advice and Guidance Request from the CodeableConcept [eRS-Priority-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/eRS-Priority-1) |
| category | The status of the Advice and Guidance Request. A Codeable Concept from [eRS-AdviceAndGuidanceStatus-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/CodeSystem/eRS-AdviceAndGuidanceStatus-1) |
| adviceLastUpdated | DateTime when the Advice and Guidance Request was last updated |
| adviceFirstRequested | DateTime when the Advice and Guidance Request  was first requested |
| referrer | The Referrer of the Advice and Guidance Request. Reference to a Practitioner by UID in SDS |

| namedClinician | Reference to a Practitioner used within the Service Search by UID in SDS. Only present if service search included 'Named Clinician'. |
| patient | Reference to the Patient associated with the Advice and Guidance Request by NHS Number. |

The ‘item.reference’ field within each entry in the FHIR List returned is a reference to a FHIR ‘CommunicationRequest’ resource. This reference can be used to retrieve the full Advice and Guidance Request as a FHIR ‘CommunicationRequest’ resource.  

CodeableConcept https://_baseURL_/STU3/CodeSystem/eRS-CommunicationListSelector-1 is new for this worklist. It has, for now, only a single value as follows:  

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ----------- |
| ADVICE_AND_GUIDANCE_REQUESTS | Select the ‘Advice and Guidance Requests’ worklist |
