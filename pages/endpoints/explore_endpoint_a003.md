#### Status: ![Deprecated](images/icons/api_deprecated.png)

This endpoint has been deprecated, meaning you should not use it for new integrations.

Instead, please use our newer e-RS FHIR API solution which is documented here:
[https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir)
