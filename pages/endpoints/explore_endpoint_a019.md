| Method | URL | Authentication |
| -------------| --- | ---------------- |
| POST | /STU3/v1/ReferralRequest/[UBRN]/$ers.generatePatientLetter | Session Token [(Details)](develop_business_flow_bf001.html) |

### Description
As a Referring Clinician (/Administrator) having created a referral  
I want to retrieve the patient's letter  
So that the patient has all the necessary details to choose the clinic they want to attend and book an appointment  

This endpoint is to be used as part of the [Create Referral](develop_business_flow_bf004.html) workflow.

### Prerequisite Operations
A referral must exist and the user must legitimately have access to it. A letter can be re-printed multiple times, but the current API only supports the scenario of referrals that don't have an appointment booked.

| Accept | `application/pdf` |
| Content-Type |	`application/fhir+json` |

#### Request Body
This operation does not require a body. 
The operation definition for this endpoint is available on the FHIR server: [eRS-GeneratePatientLetter-Operation-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/OperationDefinition/eRS-GeneratePatientLetter-Operation-1)
