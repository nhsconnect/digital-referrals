#### Status: ![Deprecated](images/icons/api_deprecated.png)

This endpoint has been deprecated, meaning you should not use it for new integrations.

Instead, please use our newer e-RS FHIR API solution which is documented here:
[https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir)

## Description
This API lets users retrieve and download linked files for a referral, also known as attachments.

Note: The AttachmentLogicalID won’t be made available explicitly, but the full path required to retrieve the attachment is returned by [A005 Retrieve Referral Request](explore_endpoint_a005.html). The path to the attachment can be found in the “url” field of the DocumentReference.content.attachment in the contained section of the ReferralRequest resource.

## Resource URL
