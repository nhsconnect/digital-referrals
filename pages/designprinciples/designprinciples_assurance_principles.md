- assurance should be lightweight but appropriate
- testing should be automated where possible to establish technical conformance
- a level of self-certified solution assurance will be made available to organisations deploying the APIs
- all artefacts related to assurance and testing should be made available as part of the ecosystem (public domain) prior to engaging in a formal NHS Digital assurance process
- a set of evidence based around self-assurance activities will speed up the assurance process
