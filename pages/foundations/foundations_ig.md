## Patient dissent to share flag ##

When Foundations APIs are used to support the Appointment Management capability, the above flag SHALL NOT be applied by provider systems.

## PDS S-flagged patients ##

If, in response to the Find or Read a Patient API, the provider system determines that a patient has a PDS 'S-Flag', then the patient's location and contact details are to be replaced by those of the target GP practice.
