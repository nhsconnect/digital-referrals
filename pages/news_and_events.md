We connected with both stakeholders and industry at a collaborative and innovative event - over 150 people, including a delegation who flew over from Stanford University in the United States, attended our Technical Connectathon in Leeds.

The event focused on interoperability, and the consistent exchange of information which empowers health and care professionals to make better use of patient data across organisational boundaries and different clinical contexts.

One of the ways of making systems interoperable across boundaries is by developing an Application Programming Interface (API), which allows different systems to connect to each other. At the Connectathon, attendees were able to test a range of APIs in trial implementation settings, share learnings, and work together to solve problems. Attendees also had the opportunity to learn more about a range of NHS Digital projects programme via presentations and workshops.

The following programmes provided APIs to test: CareConnect, e-Referral Service and Organisation Data Service. Presentations were delivered by: CareConnect, e-Referral Service, Organisation Data Service, National Record Locator Service, Digital Child Health and GP Connect.

## 23rd February 2018 - Digital Health Webinar

The NHS e-Referral Service has been working with partners to develop and release new Application Programming Interface (API) functionality. In this webinar, Dr Paul Denton (NHS e-Referral Service Programme Manager) presented in collaboration with Digital Health, PCTI Solutions Limited and Western Sussex Hospitals NHSFT and provided a high-level overview of recent developments, by focusing on the project initiation from one partnership between NHS e-Referral Service, Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and PCTI Solutions Limited.

## 21st April 2017 – NHS e-Referral Service Integration Roadmap
We are listening to your views and have been asking users and integration stakeholders what improvements they would like us to make to the NHS e-Referral Service, so that the service is continually improved to make it easier, quicker and more efficient for third party solutions to connect and use. Your feedback is helping us produce a ‘roadmap’ of integration developments.

As such, The NHS e-Referral Service has now released its first Integration Roadmap which aims to explain the system based integration enhancements and when they are being delivered. These represent key milestone themes when new functionality will be released for users to  commence their own development, assurance and compliance activities against.

## 24th December 2016 – Clinical Referral Information (CRI) APIs
The latest software development phase of the NHS e-Referral Service has now been completed and is available for collaborating business partner review. Through the delivery of the API Beta Project a package of eight APIs have now been made available within the API Sandpit and e-RS/DEV1 Path-To-Live (PTL) environments. These will allow partners to:

* Authenticate to the NHS e-RS Application using a Organisation and Role based session token.
* Search for a Unique Booking Reference Numbers (UBRN) using a Referrals for Review Worklist and Speciality search.
* Retrieve Clinical Referral Information comprising Header, Referral Reason, PDF Clinical Information and Supplementary Attachments.
* Logout from the session.

Early adopters can now request e-RS/DEV1 test data packs, smartcards and prototype support tooling to commence solution elaboration, design and prototyping through the SA Service Desk.
