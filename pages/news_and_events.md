## 17th December 2018 - Imperial College Healthcare NHSFT goes live using e-RS Integration APIs
![People Logo](images/news/People.png)

A successful collaborative project, between Imperial College Healthcare and the NHS e-Referral Service, recently delivered the first business partner implementation of the Service’s new Application Programming Interface (API) functionality. Imperial are an innovative Trust of 10,000 people, providing care for around a million people every year, in their five hospitals and a growing number of community services in north west London. An interoperability partnership was quickly established between Imperial’s ICT Projects and the Service’s Integration Portfolio Teams and then tasked with making available the Clinical Referral Information (CRI) or ‘Referral Letter’ within the e-RS application to Imperial’s internal document repository and online vetting solution. Through close technical and implementation collaboration, a new Target Operating Model (TOM) approach for product assurance was piloted leading to a successful launch on the 17th December 2018. This is now helping the Trust to realise its NHS England Paper Switch Off (PSO) Programme benefits, reducing administrative costs, achieving quicker patient care and providing a firm foundation for deeper clinical review integration, associated to the processing of over 100,000 first outpatient appointment each year.

## November 2018 - New Path to Live Environment for Partners  
![PTL Environments Image](images/news/PTL_Environments.PNG)

The NHS e-Referral Service has now delivered a new Application Programming Interface (API) focused Path-to-Live environment (PTL). This has been called e-RS DEV3 and is now accessible through the Development (DEV) Care Identity Service (CIS) and Spine Core network domain.
The new environment will act as a test repository for the growing range of NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS) Alpha APIs. As this environment will exist outside of the monthly PTL e-RS release cycle, it is now able to provide increased responsiveness to new user needs and change requests. The e-RS Integration Portfolio Team will be able to design, implement and release new, agile functionality and respond to changes within a period of days rather than the existing monthly release cycle. The existing Alpha APIs have now been removed from the main software branch and the existing PTL environments, to help in the maintenance of an efficient, operational code base. This does not affect existing users of the Clinical Referral Information (CRI) APIs as these are fully live and available in the core software release. Connectivity information and service notifications are now available through the NHS Digital Assurance Support Portal.


## 1st October 2018 - Referral Request API Suite  
![Referral Suite Image](images/news/gp_service.jpg)

Through successful external stakeholder engagement, the NHS e-Referral Service has now commenced activity to design, build, release and assure a new, live Beta suite of referral APIs. This activity builds upon end user and systems supplier feedback on the elaboration and prototyping of an early Alpha suite, allowing end users the ability to create quick and easy referrals in the e-RS solution. The planned live suite will support an application workflow equivalent to the current Professional Application interface functionality, with compliant systems able to search for patient services, create a referral, upload clinical attachment(s) and print the patient referral request letter. This roadmap deliverable represents the completion of development and release of new APIs into the live service application code and made available for collaborating partners to commence development and assurance.


## 5th September 2018 - 100 percent of trusts have now switched over to the NHS e-Referral Service

A total of 150 acute hospital trusts and 7,110 GP practices have made the move to sending and receiving all first outpatient appointments through the NHS e-Referral Service (e-RS). This means that all acute trusts managed to beat the 1 October deadline to fully move to e-RS.

Trusts that have already made the move to using e-RS full-time have reported that patients on average receive appointments eight days faster, that the number of patients that fail to attend appointments has dropped by up to half and patients have greater control over their appointments.

The move to e-RS also helps to vastly reduce the amount of paper used in the referral process, as well as providing patients with a greater choice of when and where their appointment will take place.

From 1 October 2018, trusts will only take electronic referrals from GPs and NHS Digital and NHS England are working together to support full implementation of e-RS.

## 25th August 2018 - PRSB sets the standards for clinical referral information

New standards for sharing clinical referral information have been published by the Professional Records Standards Body (PRSB) with the aim of speeding up treatment times.

The standard has been developed with clinicians and patients, along with implementation guidance for digital referrals sent from GPs to hospitals. It is hoped that once the new standards are implemented, the exchange of referral information from GPs to hospital consultants and other professionals providing outpatient services will be improved.

The publication of the new referral standards line up with NHS Digital’s October 1 deadline, by which time trusts are to only accept e-referrals from GPs.

## 14th March 2018 - Technical Connectathon in Leeds

We connected with both stakeholders and industry at a collaborative and innovative event - over 150 people, including a delegation who flew over from Stanford University in the United States, attended our Technical Connectathon in Leeds.

<img src="images/news/connectathon-march-2018.jpg" alt="NHS e-RS Connectathon March 2018" style="width: 425px;"/>

The event focused on interoperability, and the consistent exchange of information which empowers health and care professionals to make better use of patient data across organisational boundaries and different clinical contexts.

One of the ways of making systems interoperable across boundaries is by developing an Application Programming Interface (API), which allows different systems to connect to each other. At the Connectathon, attendees were able to test a range of APIs in trial implementation settings, share learnings, and work together to solve problems. Attendees also had the opportunity to learn more about a range of NHS Digital projects programme via presentations and workshops.

The following programmes provided APIs to test: CareConnect, e-Referral Service and Organisation Data Service. Presentations were delivered by: CareConnect, e-Referral Service, Organisation Data Service, National Record Locator Service, Digital Child Health and GP Connect.

## 23rd February 2018 - Digital Health Webinar

## 21st April 2017 – NHS e-Referral Service Integration Roadmap
We are listening to your views and have been asking users and integration stakeholders what improvements they would like us to make to the NHS e-Referral Service, so that the service is continually improved to make it easier, quicker and more efficient for third party solutions to connect and use. Your feedback is helping us produce a ‘roadmap’ of integration developments.

As such, The NHS e-Referral Service has now released its first Integration Roadmap which aims to explain the system based integration enhancements and when they are being delivered. These represent key milestone themes when new functionality will be released for users to  commence their own development, assurance and compliance activities against.

## 24th December 2016 – Clinical Referral Information (CRI) APIs
The latest software development phase of the NHS e-Referral Service has now been completed and is available for collaborating business partner review. Through the delivery of the API Beta Project a package of eight APIs have now been made available within the API Sandpit and e-RS/DEV1 Path-To-Live (PTL) environments. These will allow partners to:

* Authenticate to the NHS e-RS Application using a Organisation and Role based session token.
* Search for a Unique Booking Reference Numbers (UBRN) using a Referrals for Review Worklist and Speciality search.
* Retrieve Clinical Referral Information comprising Header, Referral Reason, PDF Clinical Information and Supplementary Attachments.
* Logout from the session.

Early adopters can now request e-RS/DEV1 test data packs, smartcards and prototype support tooling to commence solution elaboration, design and prototyping through the Platforms Support Desk.
