## Clinical Safety Framework

### Clinical Safety Assurance Process
- #### Risk Assessment
  An initial assessment of potential risks.
- #### Hazard Log  
  A list of identified hazards with details of impact and mitigations.
- #### Patient Safety Assessment (PSA)
  A recorded meeting where patient safety is reviewed.
- #### Clinical Safety Case Report
  A document bringing together the Risk Assessment, Hazard Log and minutes of the PSA.
- #### Target Operating Model
  A self-assessment declaration that the above documentation and processes have taken place and been recorded. A completed TOM must be submitted to NHS Digital and signed off prior to any deployment of software utilising any e-RS APIs. Information on the TOM can be found [here](assure_tom.html).

Templates for a Hazard log and Clinical Safety Case Report can be downloaded from the [NHS Digital Clinical Safety](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/solution-assurance/the-clinical-safety-team/clinical-safety-documentation#clinical-risk-management) website.
