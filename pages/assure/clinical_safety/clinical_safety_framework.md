### Clinical Safety Assurance Process
-  
-  
-  


### Assurance Documentation
- Initial hazard assessment
- Hazard log which forms part of the clinical safety case.
- The clinical safety case details the safety approach for the development of a product and also includes the minutes of
- Patient safety assessments (PSA). PSAs are held to record how the development is addressing the identified hazards and to check for new hazards.
- A Clinical Authority To Release (CATR) certificate is needed for a product to be released into live. To obtain a CATR the finished Clinical Safety Case is distributed to the NHSD Clinical Safety panel, who conduct an assessment to decide whether the development is safe and issue the CATR.
