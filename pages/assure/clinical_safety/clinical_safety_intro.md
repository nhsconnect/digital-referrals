## Introduction

APIs allow Clinical Software programmes to integrate with the NHS e-Referral Service to allow eRS functionality to be accessed within the clinical software system. A clinical software system may use some or all of the available APIs to carry out some or all of the NHS e-Referral service functionality within their system.  

For each use of APIs by a third party clinical software company the Target Operating Model (TOM) document will need to be completed assuring that both the third party companyâ€™s use of the e-RS APIs and the end user organisation's use of the software is complaint with DCB0129 and DCB0160.  

Using the TOM document the software company and end user organisation can assess and record the clinical safety case for the use of the NHS e-Referral APIs with varying involvement of the NHS e-Referral Clinical safety Team, dependant on the level of risk the functionality within the APIs pose.
