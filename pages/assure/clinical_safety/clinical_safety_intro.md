# Clinical Safety Guidance for e-RS API Integration

## Introduction

APIs allow Clinical Software programmes to integrate with the NHS e-Referral Service to allow eRS functionality to be accessed within the clinical software system. A clinical software system may use some or all of the available APIs to carry out some or all of the NHS e-Referral service functionality within their system.  

For each use of APIs by a third party clinical software company the new TOM will need to be completed assuring that the third party companyâ€™s use of the e-RS APIs is complaint with DCB0129 and DCB0160 and other requirements.  

Using the Target Operating Model (TOM) document the software company is responsible for the clinical safety case for the use of the NHS e-Referral APIs with varying involvement of the NHS e-Referral Clinical safety Team, dependant on the level of risk the functionality within the APIs pose.
