## Overview

The overall NHS Digital approach to compliance is based on the Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) and the End User Online Declaration (EUOD), together these documents allow suppliers and end user organisations to self-certify that their products and solutions are compliant with appropriate NHS standards, specific e-RS compliance requirements and are clinically safe and fit for purpose.

### Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL)  

The Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL) is a technical document which details the supplier approach to information governance, clinical safety, functional testing and e-Referrals requirements. This document will be provided to you by NHS Digital and guidance on how to complete the SCAL is detailed in the document itself.

The latest version of the SCAL should be obtained from [functional.assurance@nhs.net](mailto:functional.assurance@nhs.net).

If a supplier has not worked with NHS Digital before, there is also a requirement for them to register to use the NHS Digital National Service Desk [(ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net)](mailto:ssd.nationalservicedesk@nhs.net) to log incidents.

#### Submitting the SCAL
Once the document has been completed, it should be submitted by email to [functional.assurance@nhs.net](mailto:functional.assurance@nhs.net) who will review it and issue a Technical Conformance Certificate.

Once a technical conformance certificate has been issued, it should be embedded into the SCAL document and submitted by email to [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net).  

### Connection Agreement
In order to connect to the live service APIs a connection agreement must be signed by the owner of the connecting system. This should be obtained from [interop.mgmt@nhs.net](mailto:interop.mgmt@nhs.net), signed and returned by email.  

### End User Organisation Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
The End User Organisation Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) sets out the obligations of the End User Organisation and those of the Connecting Party in relation to that useage.

Further guidance on the End User Organisation Acceptable Use Policy can be found via the Onboarding section of [https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/e-referral-service-fhir#api-description__onboarding).

## Special Terms

The NHS e-Referral API [Special Terms](assure_special_terms.html) are applicable to all supplier and provider partners and should be read in conjunction with the End User Policy and Connection Agreement above.
