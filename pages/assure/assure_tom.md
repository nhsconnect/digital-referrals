The Target Operating Model is a light-weight framework used for you to self-assure your own system confirming it meets the requirements and passes compliance.

The document itself is a multi-sheet spreadsheet with a variety of areas which need to be filled in by the *end user organisation*, the *solution supplier* and *NHS Digital*. These areas are divided into Contact information, Topology, Architecture, IG & Security, Clinical Safety and Service.

In the process of self-assurance you will progress through the following three phases:

* Phase 1A - Usage and Settings submission for approval by NHS Digital
* Phase 1B - Technical Conformance for approval by NHS Digital
* Phase 2 - Full TOM and Product evaluation by the End User Organisation

Phase 2 may be conducted in parallel to phase 1A and 1B to expedite the process, whilst acknowledging a go-live dependency of approval to access central data being granted. 

Note: Before any deployment can commence, the solution supplier must sign the _Connection Agreement_ and the end user must sign the _End User Policy_.
