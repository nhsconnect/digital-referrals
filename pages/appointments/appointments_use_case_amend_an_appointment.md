---

## Use case ##

The typical flow to amend an appointment is:

 1. Search by `NHS Number` for, or otherwise obtain, a `Patient` resource.
 2. Search for `Appointment` resources for the `Patient` resource.
 3. Choose an `Appointment` resource and update its `description` or `comment` details.

{% include important.html content="The Appointment Management capability pack is aimed at administration of a patient's appointments. As a result of information governance (IG) requirements, the amend appointments capability has been restricted to future appointments. More details are available on the [Design decisions](appointments_design.html#viewing-and-amending-booked-appointments) page." %}

## Security ##

- GP Connect utilises TLS Mutual Authentication for system level authorization
- GP Connect utilises a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to transmit clinical audit and provenance details 

## Prerequisites ##

### Consumer ###

The consumer system:

- SHALL have previously resolved the organisation's FHIR endpoint base URL through the [Spine Directory Service](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_spine_directory_service.html)
- SHALL have previously traced the patient's NHS Number using the [Personal Demographics Service]( https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/integration_personal_demographic_service.html) or an equivalent service
- SHALL have previously found the appointment ID using [Retrieve a patient's appointments](https://nhsconnect.github.io/gpconnect/appointments_use_case_retrieve_a_patients_appointments.html)

## API usage ##

The consumer system SHALL only use the amend appointment capability to amend future appointments where appointment start dateTime is after the current date and time. If the appointment start date is in the past the provider SHALL return an error.

### Request operation ###

#### FHIR relative request ####

```http
PUT /Appointment/[id]
```

#### FHIR absolute request ####

```http
PUT https://[proxy_server]/https://[provider_server]/[fhir_base]/Appointment/[id]
```

#### Request headers ####

Consumers SHALL include the following additional HTTP request headers:

| Header               | Value |
|----------------------|-------|
| `Ssp-TraceID`        | Consumer's TraceID (i.e. GUID/UUID) |
| `Ssp-From`           | Consumer's ASID |
| `Ssp-To`             | Provider's ASID |
| `Ssp-InteractionID`  | `urn:nhs:names:services:gpconnect:fhir:rest:update:appointment-1` |

#### Payload request body ####

The request payload is a profiled version of the standard FHIR [Appointment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/appointment.html) resource. See [FHIR resources](/datalibraryappointment.html) page for more detail.

Consumer systems:
- SHALL send an `Appointment` resource that conforms to the [GPConnect-Appointment-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-Appointment-1) profile.
- SHALL include the URI of the `GPConnect-Appointment-1` profile StructureDefinition in the `Appointment.meta.profile` element of the appointment resource.

Only the following data-elements can be modified when performing an appointment amendment:
- `description`
- `comment`
- `Appointment cancellation reason` extension, which SHALL only be amended when the appointment status is `cancelled`.

{% include note.html content="For providers who only support the mandatory `description` element and not the `comment` element. If a `comment` is received as part of the amendment the provider SHOULD append the content of the comment to the description within the appointment so that the additional information is not lost." %}

To reduce the risk of information being truncated when stored on the providers side, consumers SHALL impose:
- a 100 character limit on the appointment `description` element when editing a GP Connect appointment.
- a 500 character limit on the appointment `comment` element when editing a GP Connect appointment.

On the wire a JSON serialised request would look something like the following:

```json
{
	"resourceType": "Appointment",
	"id": "9",
	"meta": {
		"versionId": "636068818095315079",

	},

	}],

	"participant": [{

	},
	{
		"actor": {
			"reference": "Location/32",
			"display": "Leeds GP Clinic"
		},
		"status": "accepted"
	}]
}
```

#### Error handling ####

The provider system:

- SHALL return an [GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/GPConnect-OperationOutcome-1) resource that provides additional detail when one or more request fields are corrupt or a specific business rule/constraint is breached.
- SHALL return an error if any appointment details other than the appointment `comment`, `description` or `cancellation reason` are amended. The appointment resource should be considered invalid and the provider system should return a `422` error with error code `INVALID_RESOURCE`.
- SHALL return an error if the appointment being amended is in the past (the appointment start dateTime is before the current date and time).

Refer to [Development - FHIR API guidance - error handling](development_fhir_error_handling_guidance.html) for details of error codes.


### Request response ###

#### Response headers ####

Provider systems are not expected to add any specific headers beyond that described in the HTTP and FHIR&reg; standards.

#### Payload response body ####

Provider systems:

- SHALL return a `200` **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.

- SHALL include the URI of the `GPConnect-Appointment-1` profile StructureDefinition in the `Appointment.meta.profile` element of the returned appointment resource.
- SHALL include the `versionId` of the current version of the appointment resource.
