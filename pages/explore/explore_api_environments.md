summary: "Access and explore the three supporting e-Referral API environments"
---

To support the development of APIs within the Ecosystem, there are three supporting environments. These comprise:

* Development
* Integration
* Deployment

![Environments](images/explore/Environments.png)

All of these environments reside on the N3 network and access therefore requires proper registration and physical smart cards. This is managed by Platforms Support Desk.

We use the existing Path to Live structure - more information about connectivity can be found at the [Assurance Portal](http://www.assurancesupport.digital.nhs.uk/) (only available on N3) - further information available from Platforms Support Desk.
