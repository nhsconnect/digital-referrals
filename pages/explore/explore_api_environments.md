---

To support the development of APIs within the Ecosystem, there are two supporting environments. These comprise:

## API Development Sandpit ##

* [Access](http://api1:82/login_dev_work?nocardreader=1)

This comprises a full Virtual Machine installation of a NHS e-RS environment. This environment is operated through mock (non-Spine connected) authentication routines and test data.

## API Console ##

* [Access](http://api1:8080/swagger-ui/)

This is uses the Swagger open source tool to present a simple yet powerful representation of the NHS e-RS APIs, to provide interactive documentation, endpoint generation and discoverability.
