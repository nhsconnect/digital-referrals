## Application Programming Interface (API) ##

A key aspect of the NHS e-RS vision is to enable local innovation and adoption of paperless referrals. You can do this in a secure and controlled manner using our API. The APIs are a well-defined interface aiding new software solutions in a simple way.

We want to stimulate and assist your development of applications linked to the NHS e-RS via its API. We describe and provide the usual tasks and support documents you will need here.

## Ecosystem ##

The site has five main parts. Each aligns to a phase of development and partner engagement with NHS Digital, as shown below. The Communication Channels let you engage with each phase of the Ecosystem. They are enabling components.
